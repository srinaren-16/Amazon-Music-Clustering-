# Amazon-Music-Clustering-
Amazon Music Clustering is an unsupervised ML project that groups songs based on audio features like danceability, energy, tempo, and valence. Using K-Means, PCA, and evaluation metrics such as Silhouette Score, it identifies meaningful clusters to support playlist curation, recommendations, and music analytics without genre labels.
